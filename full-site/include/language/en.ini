        <p>Тут використано притаманну старому місту стратегію квартальної забудови. Це простір, де відсутні хмарочоси та гігантські проспекти, лише розвинена система вулиць, значна частина з яких — пішохідні. Передбачені активні перші поверхи роблять житловий район ідеальним не лише для проживання, а й виграшним майданчиком для всіх видів підприємництва.</p>
        <p>Тут можна відкрити магазин, ресторан, кафе, філію банку, салон краси, фітнес-клуб, фотостудію або розмістити свій офіс.</p>
        <h2>Переваги комерційної нерухомості у Рибальському</h2>
        <p>Для зручності мешканців та відвідувачів Рибальського нежитлову нерухомість буде рівномірно розподілено — біля води з’явиться ресторанна вулиця, а просторий бульвар буде використано для бутіків. Враховуючи те, що загальна чисельність мешканців Рибальського перевищуватиме 20 000 (вже у перших 9 кварталах очікується, що їх кількість складатиме 4 000), а також беручи до уваги безперервний потік жителів міста, запевняємо, що територія буде користуватися неабияким попитом.

i-mes10='The developers decided to breathe new life into the RYBALSKY peninsular and let the capital have it back revived and renewed. Now its time for the new RYBALSKY residential neighbourhood to rise here where everyone will be able to enjoy the beauty of life right in the heart of an urban hub without conventional stuff like noisy and clamorous motorways.'
i-mes11='<p>The unique location of this complex has influenced the approach to its architecture. The developer has resorted to the time-proven site development policy for Podil, reviewing it completely and making it possible for the new residential buildings to fit perfectly the surrounding landscape. There will be no commonplace gray skyscrapers but primarily nine-storey buildings with enclosed courtyards and elaborated network of side streets. There will be no random vendor booths or chaotic advertisement so as not to spoil the looks of well-kept streets. Besides, the area of RYBALSKY residential neighbourhood will be video-monitored round-the-clock by appropriate security services.</p><h2>Residential Complex in Downtown</h2><p>RYBALSKY residential neighbourhood is located 10-15 minutes` drive away from Poshtova Ploshcha and Kontraktova Ploshcha underground stations. There are the picturesque Andriyivskyy Descent, unrivalled Sophia`s Square, Michael`s Square and a little bit downwards - downtown - the business-like Khreshchatyk and Independence Square.</p><h2>Benefits</h2><p>Podil has long been known for its enchanting beauty and remarkable architecture. We seek to preserve this authenticity of the area, implanting something brand new and unique: for example, boulevards in the style of French Cannes to arrange public gardens and amphitheatres for holding summer parties.</p><h2>Special Features</h2><p>RYBALSKY residential neighbourhood is, first and foremost, the place for living. This is why there will be no residential skyscrapers but predominantly nine-storey buildings. It is so because this height does not obstruct the sky and people find it very agreeable.</p><p>For the record, RYBALSKY residential neighbourhood provides an exceptional system of channels and boulevards, a two-tier underground level parking, a developed infrastructure which includes vegetable shops, medical institutions and study centres.</p><h2>Opening</h2><p>In the I-II quarter of 2018, we will complete the construction of the first two houses of the RYBALSKY residental neighbourhood! Just now, you can purchase the real estate by merely ordering a call - and our sales department experts will call you back at your convenience. You will be also kindly invited to take a guided tour round the construction site where you will be able to watch the progress of the construction of RYBALSKY residential neighbourhood.</p><h2>Payment by Instalment</h2><p>We would also like to offer you <a href="https://rybalsky.com.ua/en/rassrochka/
" title="to purchase apartment in RYBALSKY in instalments">to purchase the apartment in instalments </a>. The first payment makes up only 10%. The payment may be divided into portions to be paid throughout 36 months later on. The instalment payment program is calculated on a case-by-case basis. More details you can find out at our sales department.</p>'
i-mes12='Choose Your Apartment in RYBALSKY Residential Neighbourhood'
i-mes13='RN RYBALSKY is a picturesque area in the downtown of Kyiv located on the RYBALSKY Peninsula near the Dnipro River. You can reach the city centre or the most important historic places or squares of the capital from here by car in 15 minutes. Even if you prefer to leave your car at home, buses and shuttle vans running between Podil and Obolon are at your service.'
i-mes14='<h2>Why Worth Purchasing Apartment in Downtown</h2><p>If you want to purchase an apartment in a newly-built apartment block, then make it a point that RYBALSKY is a new-type residential neighbourhood: you will find no cars near the entrance halls - those will find their place only in the underground parking lots; the city noise will never disturb you here because we shall introduce a top-quality sound-proof insulation system. The area of RN RYBALSKY will prove ideal for walking and bicycling thanks to the construction of super-blocks.</p><h2>Infrastructure</h2><p>The residential neighbourhood RYBALSKY will have nine apartment-block buildings, with the eight of them to be allocated for residence and the other to be built as an educational facility. Moreover, the RYBALSKY area will have lots of places for recreation and leisure: shops, restaurants, beauty parlours, boulevards and channels. The developer has taken special care of the sophisticated medical infrastructure and that is why the area will accommodate out-patient facilities, polyclinics and even veterinary offices.</p><p>Besides, RYBALSKY will also have lots of athletic fields and playgrounds, fitness centres and sports clubs. The renewed Sailors’ Park with bicycle roads and pet relief areas will become one of the attractions of the neighbourhood where various leisure activities will be available for revellers.</p><h2>Price</h2><p>If you decide to purchase an apartment in a newly-built apartment block near the Dnipro River, please study our master layout plan posted on our site. You may choose the section, building, floor, layout and the preferred number of rooms.</p><p>The first two residential blocks of RN RYBALSKY will have 630 apartments (from 1-room to 5-room apartments, more than 90 layouts available). Also, at your option, your apartment may have a free layout. For more details about the cost of the real estate you may contact our Sales Department by ordering a call-back and our experts will give you feedback at your convenience.</p><p>We shall be pleased to answer all your questions and invite you to take a tour around the construction site where you will be able to see the progress of the construction of the residential neighbourhood. By the way, we can offer every customer to pay by instalments up to three years provided that the first contribution of 10% has been made.

			<p>In the future it is planned to separate traffic flow into two corridors in south and north directions. Traffic from Naberezhno-Khreshchatytska Street to Stepan Bandera Avenue will be the same as at present through Naberezhno-Rybalska Street. And traffic in opposite direction will be arranged through Elektrykiv Street by a specially constructed tunnel under the railway.</p>
			<p>It will unload Elektrykiv Street and the territory of Rybalsky peninsula becomes easily accessible due to a network of city trains. This decision is developed in the <a target="_blank" href="https://rybalsky.com.ua/img/jurdoc/pdf/vityag_z_dpt_ribalskij.pdf">Detailed Plan of Rybalsky Territory</a> approved by the Kyiv City Council.</p>'
transport15='<p>The roadsides and sidewalks will not turn into chaotic parking, because each quarter will have a spacious two-level <a href="https://rybalsky.com.ua/en/parking/">parking</a>.

Passage will be opened from the outside of the quarter, from the site of  the street, so cars will not drive into the yard. In the underground parking of buildings No. 3 and No. 9 there will be 198 parking lots. In building No. 5 there will be 122 parking lots. Parking will be equipped with e-vehicles charging station.</p>
			<p>Parking will work according to the park sharing system: owner of a parking lot can let it on lease for the period of his absence and generate money from it. It will provide a large number of parking lots for the quests of a district. It is supposed to be 160 parking lots for guests in the “pockets”, placed in such a way so as not to impede traffic.

We understand that residents of the districts and their guests should have unhindered access to the residential neighbourhood that is why we examine the territory of the RYBALSKY peninsula, plan its connection with Podil, analyse the traffic on the highways, which run near the residential neighbourhood.</p> 
<p>The first point of improvement plan of the transport situation is distribution of traffic flows: traffic from Naberezhno-Khreshchatytska Street to Stepan Bandera Avenue will run through Naberezhno-Rybalska Street, in the opposite direction the vehicles will move on the Elektrykiv Street through a separate tunnel constructed under the railway. Also we thoroughly consider the matter of parking for cars on the territory of the RYBALSKY and maintenance of the vehicles. Each district will include commodious underground parking, one level of which will be placed on the ground floor, and the other one will be placed underground. The entrance is provided from the outside of the residential neighbourhood.</p> 
<p>Underground parking has complicated engineering constructions, their building demands significant investments and compliance with the unambiguous requirements for the outfit: waterproofing course, lighting, fire extinguishing and smoke removal systems.

Garages, which fill large squares of an adjacent territory, entire car parking near the buildings, which always obstruct the road, and yards that turn into a traffic area – this everything is the list of disadvantages, which the residents and guests of the residential neighbourhood will not notice.</p> 
<p>In a process of construction of the RYBALSKY we focus on the examples of development of the European neighbourhoods and establish new space for Kyiv – modern, open and safe at the same time. Parking in the buildings will become efficient solution. Underground parking in the residential building is a comfortable and reliable means for maintenance of a vehicle. Due to innovation technologies, security and all day and CCTV monitoring, the owner of the vehicle can be sure that everything is under control. Besides, a car is protected from weather conditions, what reduces its need for repair thrice. Even during a cold season an optimized temperature will be maintained in the underground parking.
